      <description>Through an Independent Study in the Statistics Department, my team and I are creating a mobile app for the Sports Department at the University of Virginia. The app asks sport dependent questions about both the physical and mental state of the players, and tracks performance related goals over time. The coaches can utilize this app as a way to gauge athlete performance and readiness for each match. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of the front-end development using React Native and Expo.</description>

      <description>Through an internship with an organization called the UVA&amp;rsquo;s Development Hub, my group and I created an application that used native map components and bus tracking API to display bus locations in real time. App was composed of two main tabs: one with written information regarding the bus being tracked and one with a live map showing buses. Specifically, I was in charge of creating the live map showing each bus stop and their respective projected arrival time.</description>
