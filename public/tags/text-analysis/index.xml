      <description>This project was completed for DS 5001, Exploratory Text Analytics, a class within the University of Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Master&amp;rsquo;s Program during my third year at the University of Virginia as an undergraduate student.
It used various Python packages and capabilites to delve deep into the novel &amp;ldquo;The Great Gatsby&amp;rdquo; to discover character actions, connections, and importance. While this was the main intent of the analysis, other characteristics of the novel were analyzed and explored along the way.</description>
