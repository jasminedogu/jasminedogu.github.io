      <description>This was the final project for my Practice of Data Science (DS 4001) class, and it focused on applying the machine learning algorithms learned in the course. The project aimed to accurately identify whether a patient would be diabetic or not using the Pima Americans Diabetes dataset found on Kaggle. Initially, background research on Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes and an exploratory data analysis was concluded; from there, after some data cleaning, the correct machine learning algorithms were selected.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate analyst in the Miller Lab in the Center for Public Health Genomics at the University of Virginia; at our computational biology lab, our focus is &amp;ldquo;integrating large-scale human genetics and genomics datasets with clinically relevant functional models.&amp;rdquo;
The project I am in charge of identifies differentially expressed and co-regulated genes related to coronary artery disease; this is done by applying differential gene expression and network analyses in coronary artery tissue samples using the lab&amp;rsquo;s available RNA-seq datasets.</description>

      <description>Goal of this project was to practice using Rmarkdown documents and familiarize oneself (and class) with a new package available inside the R ecosystem. My group picked Plotly and created a html presentation giving an overview (history, dependencies, etc), its usage, similar packages, and a reflection. Presentation included using the World Happiness dataset to create both 2D and 3D visuals: scatterplots (with qualitative and quantitative colorscales), bar graphs (grouped, side by side, with slider), line plots (with mode and restyle button), and chloropleth map of the world (basic and with aggregations).</description>
