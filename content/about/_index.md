My name is Jasmine Dogu, and I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia. Throughout my time at UVA, I have had the chance to take a lot of different classes and explore fields outside of my comfort zone. All of this has led me to discover my passion for the field of Data Science. I take pride in my constant efforts to better myself and pursue new challenges.

On a personal note, I am a Turkish-American and love to cook, take spin classes, and volunteer with children in STEM. Through my initiative, Women of Forge, I created a community for like-minded women to build their network, acquire leadership positions, and gain confidence in the workplace. If anything on my website seems to be of interest, please feel free to reach out. My email is ejd5mm@virginia.edu.
