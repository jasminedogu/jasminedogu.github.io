This project was completed for DS 5001, Exploratory Text Analytics, a class within the University of Virginia's Data Science Master's Program during my third year at the University of Virginia as an undergraduate student.

It used various Python packages and capabilites to delve deep into the novel "The Great Gatsby" to discover character actions, connections, and importance. While this was the main intent of the analysis, other characteristics of the novel were analyzed and explored along the way. The GitHub Repository shows all of the different levels that the corpus was broken down into and the different analyses/algorithms that were applied. Specifically, the file called "File0.ipynb", acts as a 'table of contents' for the Python code. The GitHub repository also contains a written PDF report, which takes a big picture approach at exploring the novel to create a story from the code.

The repository containing all of the files can be found below.
