This project involves backtesting a prediction model for Men's NCAA basketball games.

Current responsibilities include:  
• Utilizing SQL, data warehousing programs (AWS), Grafana, and other dashboard/visualization toolsets for data intelligence
and analysis  
• Collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing data from API’s and Python packages to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction
model  


This project began in February 2021; therefore, because it is a new project, the end goals and applications will be modified in the upcoming weeks. Please check back often for new updates on the trajectory of the project and any progress made. The repository for the prediction model my group is working on can be found below.
