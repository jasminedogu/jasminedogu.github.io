title: "SVM and RF Model Comparison for Predicting H1N1 Vaccination"
---

This project is a model comparison of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest Classifiers to predict the likelihood of an individual receiving the H1N1 vaccine. The goal was to identify the model that would most accurately and efficiently classify each group. Although multiple metrics between the predictive models were compared, an emphasis was placed on the F1 score due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. For the SVM models, both a polynomial and radial kernel were determined to be the most optimized, and these were further explored in the project. The project utilizes the LASSO Regression for feature reduction, and explores how this data sampling may impact both the SVM and Random Forest models. Lastly, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was conducted to determine statistical significance of the results.

 This project was completed in 4 days during January Term for the UVA DS 4002 course. Please see the GitHub Repository for project html, powerpoint, and R Markdown.
