title: "KNN and SVM Model Comparison for Predicting Diabetes"

This was the final project for my Practice of Data Science (DS 4001) class, and it focused on applying the machine learning algorithms learned in the course. The project aimed to accurately identify whether a patient would be diabetic or not using the Pima Americans Diabetes dataset found on Kaggle. Initially, background research on Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes and an exploratory data analysis was concluded; from there, after some data cleaning, the correct machine learning algorithms were selected. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms were chosen due to dataset size and topology. In the project, these two algorithms were explained at a high level and then applied to the Pima Americans dataset to create two distinct models. While the KNN model outperformed the SVM model even after multiple rounds of parameter tuning, both of the models had relatively high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity rates. Various metrics of the models were considered and explained thoroughly within the R Markdown file. See the project for more information regarding the dataset, KNN, SVM, and future applications.
