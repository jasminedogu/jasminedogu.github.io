I'm an undergraduate analyst in the Miller Lab in the Center for Public Health Genomics at the University of Virginia; at our computational biology lab, our focus is "integrating large-scale human genetics and genomics datasets with clinically relevant functional models."

The project I am in charge of identifies differentially expressed and co-regulated genes related to coronary artery disease; this is done by applying differential gene expression and network analyses in coronary artery tissue samples using the lab's available RNA-seq datasets. Besides working on the different stages of this project, I am also responsible for helping other undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students get adjusted to using Git/GitHub and Python due to my previous experience with the tools and language.

Current:
- Differential Expression Analysis in R on coronary vs aorta tissue (later compare with non-UVA STARNET samples (AOR))
- Differential Expression Analysis in R on ischemic vs normal tissues (using updated metadata)
- Gene based pathway enrichment analysis using GSEA or enrichR

Future:
- Cell-type specific DEG analysis using scMappR (also requires MuSiC)
- Detailed Network analyses in R
- Publish findings to a publication and present findings to the lab
