Through an Independent Study in the Statistics Department, my team and I are creating a mobile app for the Sports Department at the University of Virginia. The app asks sport dependent questions about both the physical and mental state of the players, and tracks performance related goals over time. The coaches can utilize this app as a way to gauge athlete performance and readiness for each match. Specifically, I'm in charge of the front-end development using React Native and Expo. I am working on the front-end of the coaches and the players views separately. 

Purpose:
- Create a way for coaches to check in on their players efficiently
  - Our current focus is building the app for the UVA Squash Team
- Enable a way to collect information to see changes over time

Timeline:
- This project began on September 7th 2020
- The app is projected to be finished by December 2020-January 2021
