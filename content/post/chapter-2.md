title: "Bus Location App Development"
---

Through an internship with an organization called the UVA's Development Hub, my group and I created an application that used native map components and bus tracking API to display bus locations in real time. App was composed of two main tabs: one with written information regarding the bus being tracked and one with a live map showing buses. Specifically, I was in charge of creating the live map showing each bus stop and their respective projected arrival time. Entire project was completed using React Native.

Outcome:
- Learned how to utilize Command Line Interface (CLI), Git, GitHub, Trello, React Native
- Became familiar with agile project management
- Created an app to display my understanding of React Native
