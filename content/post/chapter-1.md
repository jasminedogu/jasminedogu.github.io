title: "Plotly Analysis"
---

Goal of this project was to practice using Rmarkdown documents and familiarize oneself (and class) with a new package available inside the R ecosystem. My group picked Plotly and created a html presentation giving an overview (history, dependencies, etc), its usage, similar packages, and a reflection. Presentation included using the World Happiness dataset to create both 2D and 3D visuals: scatterplots (with qualitative and quantitative colorscales), bar graphs (grouped, side by side, with slider), line plots (with mode and restyle button), and chloropleth map of the world (basic and with aggregations).

As a result for being voted the best presentation out of all the groups, the html will be featured in the School of Data Science newsletter.
